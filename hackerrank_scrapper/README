This is still an early version of the script, but it does the job tho.
It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to scrape all the submissions due to hackerrank rate limiting. It really depends on how many submissions you have.
Changing the sleep time might get you IP banned off hackerrank due to too many requests so do keep that in mind but, since i dont have a static IP that wasn't much of a problem but just to be safe use a vpn.
I'm planning to improve the script and find the sleep time that wont cause a timeout and create a user friendly GUI.
